Win11Debloat
Win11Debloat is a simple, easy to use and lightweight powershell script that can remove
 pre-installed Windows bloatware apps, disable telemetry and declutter the experience by
 disabling or removing intrusive interface elements, ads and more. No need to painstakingly go through all the settings yourself,
 or remove apps one by one. Win11Debloat makes the process quick and easy!
You can pick and choose exactly which modifications you want the script to make, or use the default settings.
 If you are unhappy with any of the changes you can easily revert them by using the registry files that are included in the 'Regfiles' folder, all of the apps that are removed can be reinstalled from the Microsoft store.

Navigate to the Win11Debloat folder
Double click the 'Run.bat' file to start the script. Note: If the console window immediately closes and nothing happens, try the advanced method below.

A new powershell window will now open, showing the Win11Debloat menu. Select either the default or custom mode to continue.
Carefully read through and follow the on-screen instructions.
After making the selected changes the Win11Debloat script will restart the Windows Explorer process to properly apply them. If Windows Explorer does not recover after running the script and your desktop stays black, don't worry. Just press Ctrl + Alt + Del and restart your PC.

Advanced method
This method gives you the option to run the script with certain parameters to tailor the behaviour of the script to your needs and it allows you to run the script without requiring any user input during runtime, making it quicker and easier to deploy on a large number of systems.

In powershell, navigate to the directory where the files were extracted. Example: cd c:\Win11Debloat
